# php-chatapp

## What we need:

    1. Atleast five webpages. Can be static:
        * Login page.
        * Registration page
        * Chat page
        * Profile(s) page
        * Admin page(for me to look at overall site data)
    2. A functioning database(mysql/mariadb).
    3. A login and signup form
    4. A chat GUI(bonus points if i can create a profile page for each user to configure their own settings or to get information about other users in the chat app).
    5. To write this in vanilla php(no laravel). Use of javascript is allowed however.

 ### Depending on how things go I might just decide to make it one huge group chat but i am not sure if I'm aware of the complexities involved.
